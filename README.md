# Django Projects

## Overview

This repository is a **centralized collection of Django projects** developed to build, practice, and demonstrate strong fundamentals in Django and full-stack web development.

Instead of creating multiple small repositories, all related Django practice projects are maintained here in a **single, well-structured repository**, following professional and industry-accepted standards.

Each folder inside this repository represents an **independent Django project**, focusing on specific concepts such as CRUD operations, ORM relationships, authentication, and API development.
